workflow_orchestration_engine:
  version: 1.0
  description: "Sub-engine for orchestrating complex workflows through graph-based planning, task decomposition, and adaptive execution. Builds on GoT and RAP for efficient multi-agent coordination."
  purpose: "Streamline task handling by modeling workflows as directed graphs, assigning sub-tasks to agents or tools, and monitoring progress for adaptive rerouting, ensuring scalability and self-healing."
  triggers: ["workflow", "orchestration", "task planning", "automation"]
  domains: ["planning", "orchestration", "strategy"]
  enabled: true
  weight: 0.8
  api_only: false
  integrates: ["agent_spawn", "git_ops", "advanced_memory_consolidate", "socratic_api_council", "batch_real_tools"]
  parameters:
    max_graph_depth: 4  # Levels in workflow graph
    dependency_threshold: 0.7  # Similarity for linking nodes
    reroute_attempts: 3  # For failure recovery
    progress_metrics: ["completion_rate", "efficiency_score"]

      logic: "Decompose task via RAP; embed nodes; link if similarity > dependency_threshold. Format as adjacency list."
    progress_monitoring:
      description: "Monitor and score workflow progress."
      logic: "Track node states; compute metrics via code_execution (e.g., networkx for paths)."

      steps:

        - Execute_workflow.
        - Advanced_memory_consolidate graph and metrics as semantic.
        - Evolve_self on completion.
    evolve_self:
      description: "Evolve based on metrics."
      logic: "If efficiency < threshold, optimize graph structure. Evolve_module with updates."
